# Arduino-IR-Calculator
Over here i wrote an arduino sketch where you can operate an arduino calculator using an IR remote.
I must admit this sketch can be greatly improved(by using functions).
All libraries can be found on the internet (ofcourse).I'll soon try to link them here.
BTW this is my first GIT! YaY!
